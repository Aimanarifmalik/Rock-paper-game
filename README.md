The program implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C.
It prompts the user to input their choice (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors).
The computer randomly generates its choice using the rand() function from the stdlib.h library.
After both choices are made, the program compares them to determine the winner.
The result (win, lose, or tie) is then displayed to the user.
